# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
    # to define a new release
    tags:
      - "*.*.*"
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Keeps workflows shorter e.g. repeating testing
  workflow_call:
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
